I'm [Lily Riopelle](http://lilykriopelle.com), and I spend most of my time writing code and teaching full-stack Web Development at [App Academy NYC](http://appacademy.io).  Sometimes I write words, and this is where I put them.

Mostly this blog will be a collection of my thoughts on programming and teaching programming, but I reserve the right to talk about other areas of interest, including but not limited to: theatre ([look! I have another life](http://lilyriopelle.com)!), feminism, coffee, labor politics in the age of automation, and pictures of kittens/baby zoo animals.
